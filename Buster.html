        <p>My name is Buster and I'm an eight year old grey miniature poodle. I was adopted from LuLu's Pet Shop in the
        Bangor mall, but I originally came from a puppy mill in Missouri. I was a small twelve year old girl's
        divorce present. Even though she picked me out herself, at first, she didn't like me very much.
        She was a little afraid of me because I was much more hyper than her first dog, a pug named Wilson, but soon I
        began to grow on her because I would never leave her side. Even today, I don't like to go anywhere or be anywhere that's
        not directly beside her.<P/>
