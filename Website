    <P> Paragraph </P>
        My name is Buster. I am an eight year old grey and white miniature poodle. I was adopted from LuLu's Pet Shop in
    the Bangor Mall, but I'm originally from a puppy mill in Missouri. I was originally adopted as a divorce present to
    comfort a small girl who was twelve at the time.
